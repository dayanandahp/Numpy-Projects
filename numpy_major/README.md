🧮 NumPy Mathematical Calculator
A simple and interactive command-line NumPy-based calculator that performs arithmetic, statistical, and array manipulation operations using NumPy — ideal for learning and practicing fundamental NumPy operations.
🚀 Features
🔹 1. Arithmetic Operations
Perform basic element-wise mathematical calculations between two arrays:
Addition
Subtraction
Division
Floor Division
🔹 2. Statistical Operations
Analyze combined array data:
Maximum & Minimum values
Sum & Product of elements
Mean & Median
Rounded values
Standard Deviation
🔹 3. Array Manipulation
Explore various array transformations and utilities:
Concatenation of arrays
Reshaping
Sorting & Reversing
Finding unique values
Accessing first and last elements
Displaying elements greater than the mean
🧠 Concepts Used
NumPy Arrays (np.array, np.concatenate, np.reshape)
Array Operations (element-wise arithmetic and slicing)
Statistical Functions (np.mean, np.std, np.median, etc.)
Error Handling (for invalid inputs and reshaping)
Loops and Conditional Logic (menu-based interaction)
